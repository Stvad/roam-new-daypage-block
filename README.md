# Roam Research Extension: Shortcut to Create and Focus a Daily Note Block in Sidebar

This Roam Research extension provides a keyboard shortcut (**Ctrl+Shift+N**) that instantly creates a new block in your Daily Notes page, opens that block in the right sidebar, and sets focus so you can start typing immediately.
The intention is to have a quick-capture experience without switching from the context of your current work.

## How It Works
When you press **Ctrl+Shift+N**, the extension:
1. Places the new block at the bottom of the Daily Notes page.
1. Opens the block in the right sidebar.
1. Focuses the cursor on the new block, ready for editing.

## Installation
